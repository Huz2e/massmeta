On the handle of the machine, you can see barely noticeable serifs in the form of the letters 'Z' and 'V'. The last fighter holding a weapon in his hands, with the call sign 'Shoal', was reincorporated into this weapon in the form of artificial combat intelligence. His feat will be remembered forever. No one is forgotten. Nothing is forgotten. Kill validians with military style!"
